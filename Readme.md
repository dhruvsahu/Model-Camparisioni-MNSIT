# MNIST DATABASE of handwritten digits

## Description

The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

We have used three different models to classify the MNSIT data. Knn, Random Forest and Decision Tree. The accuracy of the models are as follows:

| Model | Accuracy |
| --- | --- |
| Knn | 0.97 |
| Random Forest | 0.97 |
| Decision Tree | 0.85 |

Here we can conclude that Knn and Random Forest are the best models for this dataset.

The k value of KNN with training size of 0.9 is 4 for which we got this accuracy.

The accuracy of Random Forest with training size of 0.8 is 0.97 and n_estimators value 500.
